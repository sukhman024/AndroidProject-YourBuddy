**Android app developed to help international students coming to Australia**
Nowadays lot of people are travelling to foreign countries for different purposes. Although there are number of apps in market to serve different purpose but there is no single stop solution which guide traveler for the series of instruction to be followed. Basically, this app will solve problem of “what to do and when to do” for international students/travelers in the initial release of the product. For example, there are different apps for booking accommodation and applying for part time jobs but none of them tells student when to do which activity and platform to complete that activity.
